The Falcon And The Winter Soldier Episode 5: Truth,"The fifth (and penultimate) episode of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier saw things move up a gear or ten as Sam and Bucky finally got some quality bonding time in, the show got serious about some real issues, and an unexpected cameo got tongues wagging. In our latest spoiler special podcast dedicated to the Disney+ MCU show, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis talk about all this and more, answer a bunch of listener questions (as best as they can), and the Empire Podcast Marvel Studios Fanfare Orchestra turns it up to eleven.

The Falcon And The Winter Soldier Bonus Episode: Listener Qs,"Because our last Falcon And The Winter Soldier spoiler special was a little shorter than usual (it was barely an hour long; what a disgrace), we barely scratched the surface of the listener questions you lovely lot sent in. So, in this bonus episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, and Ben Travis jettison the kazoos and the singing and the daftness to open the mailbag and dive right in, answering (as best as they can) your questions about episode 4 of FAWS, and the show in general.

Ammonite ft. Francis Lee,"Ammonite, Francis Lee's follow-up to his breathtaking debut, God's Own Country, sees Kate Winslet star as Mary Anning, a fossil hunter in 1840s England, who becomes romantically involved with a younger woman (Saoirse Ronan). Developing themes Lee explored in God's Own Country, it's a fragile and beautiful film, and in our spoiler special podcast Terri White sits down for an in-depth Squadcast chat with Lee about those themes, the film's ending, and much more. 

Then, Terri joins Chris Hewitt and Helen O'Hara for a deep dive into the film, which answers the question on everyone's lips: did Mary Anning have a dog? Find out within.

Jac Schaeffer On WandaVision,"WandaVision may have come to an end, but the MCU's first Disney+ show is still on the tip of Empire's tongue. And so, in this very special episode, Chris Hewitt sits down (across Zoom) for a chat with the show's head writer, creator, and showrunner, Jac Schaeffer, who talks about everything from the multiple fan theories that sprang up as the show was airing, to a certain theme song, and the deeply emotional ending.

Coming 2 America ft. Craig Brewer,"There have been a number of legacy comedy sequels over the last few years, with the likes of Anchorman 2, Zoolander 2 and Jay & Silent Bob Reboot all achieving varying degrees of success and critical regard. Now, 33 years after the beloved Coming To America, Eddie Murphy is back with Coming 2 America, and in this spoiler special Chris Hewitt has a chat with the film's director, Craig Brewer, about death scenes and getting the balance right between old hits and new material. They also talk about a potential new project which might just bring two classic Eddie Murphy movies together in an unexpected way. 

Then, Chris is joined by Coming To America superfans Amon Warmann and Helen O'Hara for an in-depth discussion of the film, its hits and its misses. Be warned: there's quite a bit of singing in this episode.

I Care A Lot ft. J Blakeson,"We care a lot about I Care A Lot, J Blakeson's super-sharp blackly comedic thriller in which Rosamund Pike's unscrupulous care provider exploits the heck out of the American healthcare system, only to come up against someone even more unscrupulous than her (Peter Dinklage). So much so that we've given it the spoiler special treatment. Pride of place goes to a near one-hour long interview with Blakeson, who tells Chris Hewitt all about the film's numerous twists, turns, and his storytelling motivations. 

Then, Chris is joined in the virtual podbooth by Helen O'Hara and Terri White for a fun-filled chat about the movie. Oh, and in the time-honoured tradition, we also manage to turn this into an impromptu spoiler special for the likes of Double Indemnity and Ace In The Hole, so be warned!

WandaVision Episode 9: The Series Finale,"This is it, folks. The series finale, devoted to The Series Finale. In which Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer and Ben Travis discuss all the twists and turns of the final episode of WandaVision. Do they stick the landing while talking about whether this bold, bizarre, audacious show stuck the landing? That's for you to judge. Word to the wise, though -- this week's rendition of the Marvel Studios Fanfare is not for the fainthearted, or fainteared. Approach with caution. Chaos has been embraced, and it's very far from magic.

WandaVision Episode 8: Previously On,"WandaVision stepped into uncharted territory this week, as a certain character helped another certain character take a walk down memory lane. And, as ever, that has prompted Team Empire (Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis) to discuss the revelations, theories galore (whether proved, unproved, or thoroughly debunked), and wipe a single tear rolling down their collective cheek.

Oh, and the Marvel Studios Fanfare Orchestra is on rueful, maybe even mournful, maybe even sensual form, this week.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/wandavision_episode_8_spoiler_sp_4521ec20_normal.mp3
WandaVision Episode 7: Breaking The Fourth Wall,"In our most musical episode yet (and yes, that's a warning), the Empire Podcast team of Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis tackle the seventh episode of WandaVision and, in-between bouts of song, talk about the major revelations this week (and boy, were there major revelations this week), discuss where they think the show might go in its final two episodes, and talk about the Room 237 Factor, and how it can affect audience perceptions of a TV show. And if that seems a bit highfalutin', don't worry, there'll be a silly joke along in a second.

WandaVision Episode 6,"With the home stretch just about in sight for WandaVision, the MCU's first TV show is doubling down on the weirdness and witchcraft with this very special Halloween-themed episode in which Wanda gets to know an unfamiliar face from her past, Vision turns detective, and Darcy becomes perilously close to becoming the first character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to say the F-word. 

And, naturally, Team Empire (Chris Hewitt, Ben Travis, Helen O'Hara, and James Dyer) is on hand to talk about the episode in depth, and answer your questions. As best as they can. Which isn't very well, let's be honest. But they do natter about the latest theories, exchange some harebrained thoughts of their own, and Chris overshares. 

And even though this is a Halloween episode, you'll be glad to know that Chris doesn't, for once, take the opportunity to sing the Silver Shamrock song from Halloween III: Season Of The Witch. However, there's a piece of music in this episode that is ten times more terrifying.

WandaVision Episode 5 -- On A Very Special Episode,"This week's episode of WandaVision threw more mystery ingredients into the show's ever-thickening stew, including THAT cliffhanger appearance by a very special guest star. And, in trying to explain that, and a dozen other head-scratchers, Team Empire went so far down the rabbit hole that they wound up recording an extra half-hour on Monday morning. And they're still none the wiser.

As will you, most probably. But we hope that you'll at least be entertained as Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis chase down all kinds of theories, float all kinds of idle speculation, and pay their most heartfelt, and ear-shattering, tribute yet to the Marvel Studios fanfare. 

Enjoy. And apologies.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/wandavision_episode_5_mixdownham_2e9c6e44_normal.mp3
WandaVision Episode 4,"Well, well, well... after three weeks setting up the mystery of what is happening to Wanda and Vision, this week's episode of the MCU show opened the door a crack, giving us some answers, and setting up a whole bunch of new questions at the same time. Scratching their heads, and offering increasingly barmy theories, are the usual podteam of Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer. Plus: a rendition of a certain theme that is sure to be this year's Christmas number one.

Wonder Woman 1984,"Here it is, folks. Now that we've all had a chance to see Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984, be it on your sofaplex or an actual cinema, the time has come to give our spoiler special a whirl. Recorded before its UK PVOD release (and, therefore, before we had seen the post-credits sting), this sees Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Amon Warmann, and Ben Travis get together for an in-depth natter about the movie, its themes, its lack of Eighties pop bangers, the bad guys, and much, much more. 

Life is good... but it could be better. Improve it instantly with this podcast.

WandaVision episode 3,"WHAT THE DICKENS! With its third, 70s-set episode, WandaVision moves into even more bizarre and unsettling territory as Wanda finds herself going through a very accelerated pregnancy, Vision begins to have misgivings about what's going on under the surface, and Geraldine says something she shouldn't. 

And in this episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer discuss the goings-on in great detail, offer more possibly preposterous theories about what's going on, answer listener questions as best as they can, and pay Michael Giacchino the ultimate mark of respect.

WandaVision episodes 1 and 2,"FLOURISH! 

At long, long last, normal service (of sorts) has resumed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the debut of WandaVision, the bonkers show-within-a-show that sees the return of one of the MCU's power couples, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany). Only they're seemingly trapped in a sitcom. And Vision's not dead. So something is amiss. But what could it be? And who might be behind it? 

In the first of our WandaVision spoiler specials, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis try to answer these questions, and fail miserably. But along the way they throw out wild theories about the show's ultimate destination, have a singalong with the Marvel Studios fanfare, indulge in the usual nonsense, and answer the biggest question of them all: who would win in a fight... Vision, or Baby Yoda?

Soul (Part Two),"Hot on the heels of our first Soul spoiler special (which featured interviews with director Pete Docter, co-director Kemp Powers, and producer Dana Murray), now it's time for Team Empire to talk about this melon-twisting slice of animated goodness. Join Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Amon Warmann, and Alex Godfrey as they talk about the film's high-falutin' concepts, its status as the first Pixar movie to feature a Black lead character, and they discuss the biggest question of them all: how did Graham Norton wind up in a Pixar movie?

"Soul Part One ft. Pete Docter, Kemp Powers and Dana Murray","Soul, Pete Docter's latest noodle-baking slice of Disney/Pixar magic, is a big movie that tackles big themes (and also has a bit where a cat cuts someone's hair). So, naturally, our spoiler special is suitably-sized in response. In the first part of this two-parter, Chris Hewitt sits down for virtual chats with the film's director, Docter, his co-director/co-writer Kemp Powers, and producer Dana Murray. They talk about a whole bunch of stuff, including the film's ending, the very different form it once took, the challenges of making difficult philosophical concepts easy to grasp for audiences, and the body-swap storyline that has generated some controversy. 

Part Two will see Team Empire talk about the film.

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation ft. Jeremiah S. Chechik,"Merry Christmas, everyone! Here's a little Christmas bonus for you all, and one that doesn't involve kidnapping Brian Doyle-Murray from his home, tying him in a giant red ribbon, and bringing him home to place him under the tree. Instead, on this Christmas Eve, Team Empire invites you to dive deep into the all-time Chrimbo comedy classic that is National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (or National Lampoon's Winter Holiday, as it is also known these days). 

As well as a lengthy interview in which Chris Hewitt talks to the film's director, Jeremiah S. Chechik, about his memories of making the Chevy Chase chucklefest, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara and Nick de Semlyen for a fun-filled chat about the movie. Warning: may contain stories about marauding squirrels. 

Merry Christmas to everyone who subscribed to the spoiler specials this year. As Cousin Eddie says, that's the gift that keeps on giving, the whole year.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/christmas_vacation_spoiler_speci_ba0d8aba_normal.mp3
Love Actually retro spoiler special,"As Alan Rickman once said, 'it's Christmas, Theo... it is a time of good cheer, so bring me my retro spoiler special on Love Actually'. OK, we're paraphrasing. But, because you demanded it after our little mini-detour on the regular pod the other week, as a very special Christmas treat, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, and Love Actually mega-fans James Dyer and Terri White (who has seen it, somehow, over 200 times) got together to have a good old natter about Richard Curtis' 2003 paean to love and the power of Christmas. 

No Richard Curtis this time (and, if we're honest, ever, if he gets around to listening to this). It's just Team Empire chewing the fat over a very divisive Christmas movie. Two of our team love it. Two of them are on the ambivalent side to say the least. So a good time is guaranteed for all -- there are terrible impressions (not all from Chris), dissection of the film's most troubling threads, and the most astonishing pronunciation of the word 'necklace' that you will ever hear.

A third part, in which Chris Hewitt, Boyd Hilton, and Beth Webb discuss the show will follow along in the next couple of days.

"Ghosts s2 Part One ft. Laurence Rickard, Martha Howe-Douglas and Ben Willbond","If you haven't already clambered aboard the Ghosts train, you really should. The BBC One sitcom, about a young couple who move into a country home that's populated by a dysfunctional family of ghosts, is created and written by, not to mention starring, the formidable comedic team of Laurence Rickard, Martha Howe-Douglas, Ben Willbond, Mathew Baynton, Jim Howick, and Simon Farnaby, and it is one of the most gloriously inventive, sweet, heartwarming and hilarious sitcoms of recent years, and is just what your 2020 needs. With the second series recently finished, and the Christmas special about to air on BBC One, this multi-part special dedicated to the show kicks off with a lengthy conversation between Rickard, Howe-Douglas and Willbond, and our very own Chris Hewitt, in which they discuss a great many things, including The Captain's sexuality, the joys of Simon Farnaby's finger, and the thin line you have to tread in a comedy when one of your main characters is called Fanny.

The Mandalorian Chapter 15 -- The Believer,"The penultimate chapter of the second season of The Mandalorian is a thrill-packed death-defying ride that tips its helmet to one of the greatest movies of all time, The Wages Of Fear. In this episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer and Ben Travis discuss that, the way in which the episode challenges Mando's core beliefs and pushes him to do something truly startling, the absence of a key character, and much, much more. Is there also singing and a plethora of helmet gags? Well, this is the way.

Plenty for our podteam — Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer — to get their teeth into, then. So, naturally, in an episode that's even more chaotic than usual, why on Corvus are they talking about Sunset Beach, Neighbours, and Han and Leia's sexual proclivities?

His House ft. Remi Weekes,"Remi Weekes' His House is not just one of the best horror films of the year, but one of the best films of the year. The tale of how two South Sudanese asylum seekers (played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku) have to contend with not only the horrors of life as refugees in the UK, but also a vengeful spirit that has taken up residence in their home, it packs plenty of shocks and social commentary into its slim running time, bolstered by Weekes' eye for an indelible image and incredible performances from Dirisu and Mosaku. 

It's a film so good that we wanted to give it the spoiler special treatment so, in this episode, Chris Hewitt has an in-depth chat with Weekes about his movie, and following that Chris is joined by Amon Warmann and Helen O'Hara to start stripping off the walls of His House to see what lurks underneath the surface.

In our extended chat, he talks to Chris Hewitt about his approach as a director, working with Baby Yoda, handling the action scenes, and more. 

Then, on the other side of Carl, Team Empire — Chris, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis — convene for another in-depth discussion of the show, featuring so much talk of baked goods that you might be forgiven for thinking you've come to the wrong show, and another landmark moment in the slow but steady, Anakin-esque corruption of the previously pure Ben Travis.

Oh, and don't query them on their knowledge of Star Wars: Rebels and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. If there's one thing that this episode makes clear, it's that the gang watch those shows religiously and know them inside out. Ahem.

The Mandalorian Chapter 9: The Marshal,"The Mandalorian is back, Baby Yoda in tow, for a second season of the Disney+ show that is breathing new life into Star Wars. And so, naturally, we've reassembled the old podcast crew -- Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis, who's this close to triggering a court order from Baby Yoda -- to have a natter about the first episode of the second season. 

It's called The Marshal, it's the longest episode to date, and it's filled with all kinds of Star Warsy goodness. And in this, the first of our weekly spoiler specials, the team discuss the episode, its numerous in-jokes, Easter eggs and references, how it might fit into the overarching story of the show and, of course, the Star Wars debut of Timothy Olyphant, making a strong play for the coveted Handsomest Man In The Galaxy award.

Rebecca ft. Ben Wheatley,"Last night, we recorded a podcast at Manderley again. And they're absolutely furious. We left Kit-Kat wrappers everywhere and broke at least one vase. Sorry! 

Anyway, Ben Wheatley's latest movie, Rebecca, is an adaptation of the classic Daphne du Maurier novel (and, it could be argued, a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 Best Picture winner) about a young woman (Lily James), who finds that her whirlwind marriage to the rich and handsome Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer), isn't enough to paper over the cracks left by his previous marriage to the titular, and very dead, Rebecca. It's lavish, well-acted, handsomely appointed and has plenty of subtext to get your teeth into, and in this spoiler special Chris Hewitt sits down with Wheatley for an in-depth chat about the film's major themes, happenings, twists and turns. 

Then, in the virtual podbooth, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara, John Nugent, and Empire's Editor-In-Chief, Terri White (who's in a tiny office, so might sound a bit echoey), for further in-depth discussion of the movie.

"Project Power ft. Henry Joost & Ariel Schulman, Mattson Tomlin","Project Power is the fun Netflix sci-fi thriller that asks the simple question: what would you do if you could take a pill that imbued you with superpowers for five minutes? Our answer, obviously, would be: make a podcast about it. 

In this jam-packed episode, Chris Hewitt sits down (virtually, of course) with the film's directors Henry & Rel, aka Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (and Henry's cat, Willy), plus screenwriter Mattson Tomlin, for a deep dive into the ins and out, twists and turns of the Jamie Foxx/Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Dominique Fishback superhero caper (without capes). 

Then Chris is joined by his colleagues of such lethal cunning, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and Amon Warmann for a lengthy discussion of the film that frequently (you have been warned) descends into anarchy. And if you think that we were on something while recording this episode, be it Power, Pro Plus or otherwise, we have this to say to you, in the wise words of William S. Sessions, former Director of the FBI: 'winners don't use drugs'. Damn straight, Bill.

Bill & Ted Face The Music ft. Dean Parisot and Ed Solomon,"Whoa, dudes! Here's a most excellent and totally non-bogus spoiler special dedicated to the third (and final?) part of the Bill & Ted trilogy, the long-awaited Bill & Ted Face The Music. In this epic episode, Chris Hewitt has a chat with the film's director, Dean Parisot, and an extended, one-hour pow-wow with the film's co-writer, and co-creator of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted 'Theodore' Logan, Mr. Ed Solomon. It's a belter, with tons of previously unheard tidbits about the creative process behind the film, so tuck in. 

And then Chris is joined by Ted-heads, and Bill-thrillers, Helen O'Hara, Nick de Semlyen, and Dan Jolin for a deep dive into the movie as well. It's non-non-non-non-non-heinous. If that's too many nons, let us know. If we've added too many, that means we're nonplussed. 

And on that cracking joke... enjoy, dudes! PARTY ON!",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/bill_and_ted_face_the_music_spoi_4295f97d_normal.mp3
"Host ft. Rob Savage, Jed Shepherd and Gemma Hurley","Happy Spookies, everyone! As October kicks off, and Halloween heaves into view, here it is at last: Empire's deep dive into the scariest horror film of the year, Rob Savage's Shudder sensation, the Zoomtastic Host, the film in which a group of women decide to hold a seance over Zoom, and find that dropped audio is the least of their worries. 

In this episode, you will find an epic and entertaining 90-minute interview with Savage and his co-writers, Jed Shepherd and Gemma Hurley, in which Chris Hewitt drills deep down into the film's origins, plot twists and turns, and the extraordinary level of detail that went into planning this movie, which was conceived, shot, edited, and released entirely during lockdown.

Then, in the virtual podbooth, Chris is joined by Ben Travis, professional fraidy-cat Amon Warmann and, for the first time on the pod, Mike Muncer, host of the excellent podcast The Evolution Of Horror, to talk about the bits that made them jump out of their skin. 

And yes, the eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed that this spoiler special is almost five times longer than the film it's spoiling specially. And it's only half as terrifying. Go figure.

Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation ft. Christopher McQuarrie,"We're not entirely sure how this happened, but as some of you pointed out, the epic Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation chat with that film's writer/director Christopher McQuarrie somehow didn't make the migration to the spoiler special subscription channel. So here you go, folks. We had to break into the underwater vault containing all our files, and find this one, but it was worth it. 

For here is the baby brother of our marathon Fallout conversations, the one that began it all, so to speak. In which Chris Hewitt invited McQuarrie into the podbooth to talk about Rogue Nation for an hour or so... and then they ended up talking for almost three. Along the way, McQuarrie sheds all kinds of light on the difficulties of making a blockbuster of this size, his approach to the characters and set pieces, the way the film's ending changed, and working with Tom Cruise. 

We can think of no better way to spend three hours. Unless you're listening to one half of our Mission: Impossible — Fallout spoiler specials, of course...

Enjoy. This podcast will self-destruct in five seconds.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/christopher_mcquarrie_mission__i_e5ac3b1d_normal.mp3
Flash Gordon ft. Mike Hodges,"Flash! AAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorry, just stubbed our toe there. 

Yes, our latest retro spoiler special is dedicated to Mike Hodges' sci-fi camp classic, FLASH GORDON. And Mr. Hodges joins Chris Hewitt, via telephone, for a deep dive into the beloved film as it celebrates its 40th anniversary. 

Then, in the remote podbooth, Chris is joined by Flash superfans Helen O'Hara and Dan Jolin as they talk about the film's innate rudeness, the Queen soundtrack, their favourite bits, and Brian Blessed shouting, ""GORDON'S ALIVE?"" Well, he is, and although he's now turned 40, he doesn't look his age. 

Enjoy! AAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorry, toe again.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/flash_gordon_spoiler_special_mix_2c2ae692_normal.mp3
Tenet,"All we have for you is a podcast, in combination with a word: Tenet. Or, if you're inverted, Tenet. 

Yes, in our latest spoiler special, Team Empire (Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and John Nugent) tackle the timey-wimey, mind-bending madness of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, and explain just what the hell was going on. Or they try to, anyway. Chris understands maybe 10% of the movie, and John around 50% (although that hasn't stopped him from promoting one of the most spurious theories surrounding the film). Thank God for James and Helen, then, who have a handle on the whole thing. Maybe. Possibly. We think. 

So, come this way for in-depth discussion, the odd outbreak of joke and, if you listen hard enough, the actual sound of Chris Hewitt's brain breaking in two. 

EnjoyojnE.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/tenet_spoiler_special_mixdownfin_3360a3b7_normal.mp3
Pitch Black ft. David Twohy,"If our last retro spoiler special didn't make you feel old with the revelation that Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is ten years old, our latest will absolutely do the trick. For Pitch Black — the low-budget sci-fi that introduced the world to Richard B. Riddick, and put Vin Diesel firmly on the path to megastardom — is twenty years old this year. 20. TWENTY. We can't believe it either. 

To mark the occasion, the film's been re-released on Blu-ray, with all the attendant bells and whistles. And happily, it not only holds up, but if anything, has aged very well. And so, to celebrate all things Pitch Black, Chris Hewitt has an extended interview with the film's writer/director, David Twohy, in which they discuss Twohy's intentions for, and memories of, shooting the film, and how they almost accidentally hit upon the idea of making Riddick, the anti-hero who can see in the dark (handy when you're on a planet suffering a years-long total eclipse of the suns, thus triggering an onslaught of ravenous alien beasties) the focus of the film. 

After that, Chris is joined by Pitch Black superfans Helen O'Hara and James Dyer for further, and very fun, discussion of the movie. 

You're not afraid of the dark, are you? Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/pitch_black_spoiler_special_mixd_66c0cdf2_normal.mp3
Scott Pilgrim Vs The World ft. Edgar Wright,"Here's a revelation even more mind-blowing than 'bread makes you fat': Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is ten years old. Yet Wright's incredibly energetic, inventive and hilarious adaptation of Bryan Lee O'Malley's series of graphic novels feels like it hasn't aged a day. Wonderful soundtrack? Check. Jawdropping fight scenes? Check. A superb cast, including Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Chris Evans, Brie Larson and more, knocking it out of the park? Obviously. 

And in this special retro spoiler podcast, Chris Hewitt catches up with Wright over SquadCast for an extended, and super-engrossing, hour-plus chat about a movie that has become a full-blown cult classic. That's followed by Chris and the rest of the podteam — Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Nick de Semlyen — convene for a big old discussion of the movie itself that, occasionally, is actually hilarious.

Hamilton (Part II),"Here it is, folks: the slightly-delayed second, and final, part of Team Empire's spoilerific deep dive into Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical Hamilton, which is now streaming on Disney+. 

In this part, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Amon Warmann, Ben Travis and Kobi Omenaka all reconvene in the virtual room where it happened to go through the second act of Miranda's masterpiece song by song, and then tackle a whole bunch of listener questions in their all-too-imitable style. Which means plenty of bad jokes, the odd bit of singing, random opinions (all double albums suck, apparently), the occasional outbreak of actual insight (quickly stamped out, you'll be glad to hear), and one member of the team develops an irrational dislike for a supporting character. Well, we all need a nemesis. 

Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/hamilton_act_ii_spoiler_special__836faa3e_normal.mp3
Hamilton (Part I),"If you've listened to the Empire Podcast for the last few years, you'll know that Chris Hewitt and (particularly) Helen O'Hara have a tendency to bang on about Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical sensation (and sensational musical), Hamilton, at every possible opportunity. But, as there wasn't a film version, we couldn't exactly give it the old spoiler special treatment. 

And then Disney+ came along, with their filmed version of the stage show with Miranda and the rest of the original Broadway cast, and we saw our chance. Here, then, is the first part of our epic Hamilton spoiler special, in which Team Empire — Chris, Helen, Amon Warmann, Ben Travis, and Kobi Omenaka — do a deep, deep dive into the musical. So deep, in fact, that we only got up to the end of the first act. Which is why there'll be a part two next week. 

Along the way, there are laughs, the odd insightful comment, mini-renditions of some of the best songs, and an opening for which we feel you should steel yourself. 

Enjoy being in the virtual room where it happens.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/hamilton_spoiler_special_part_1__7ff1ba86_normal.mp3
Gangs Of London Episode 5 ft. Gareth Evans,"The fifth episode of Gangs Of London is one of the landmarks of the televisual year, as writer/director/show-co-creator Gareth Evans brings the talent for mayhem that he honed on The Raid movies to the Welsh countryside, as a Danish hit squad lay siege to a farmhouse. There is tension, there is tons of heart, and there is the kind of sustained, ambitious action setpiece rarely seen on the small screen. 

In this episode, Chris Hewitt has an in-depth chat with Evans about the episode. And as this is a spoiler special, that includes major deaths, twists and turns, and the whole kit and caboodle. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/gareth_gangs_ep_5_spoiler_specia_886335e7_normal.mp3
John Wick ft. Chad Stahelski,"""We're thinking we're back!"" In our latest retro spoiler special, John Wick director Chad Stahelski tells Chris Hewitt how he, co-director David Leitch, writer Derek Kolstad and some dude called Keanu Reeves created one of the great action heroes of the 21st Century. In their spoiler-filled chat, Stahelski spills on iconic lines, character fates, shoot-outs, and alternate endings. You might even say it's Wick-ed. 

Then, in the virtual podbooth, Chris is joined by fellow Wickers, James Dyer, Helen O'Hara, and Ben Travis for more film-related fun as they dissect the original film in all its glory. And if you're looking for more John Wick goodness, our Chapters 2 and 3 spoiler specials are already part of your subscription. Listen to them all, or the dog gets it.

Gangs Of London episodes 1-4 ft. Gareth Evans and Corin Hardy,"Gangs Of London is pretty much everything you would expect from a TV show co-created by Gareth Evans, the maniacal mastermind behind The Raid and The Raid 2. Rather than being a Guy Ritchie-esque geezer-a-thon, it's a no-holds-barred thrill ride with some of the best action ever seen on the small screen. In this, the first in our series of spoiler special interviews dedicated to the show, Chris Hewitt sits down (remotely, of course) with Evans (who directed the 90-minute first episode) and Corin Hardy (director of episodes 2-4) for an in-depth dive into the show's twists, turns, and exploding heads.

Jack Reacher ft. Christopher McQuarrie,"Our latest retro spoiler special means you might have to take the afternoon off, as old podcast chum, Christopher McQuarrie, drops in to talk to Chris Hewitt about JACK REACHER, the 2012 movie which saw McQuarrie return to the director's chair for the first time since 2000's THE WAY OF THE GUN. 

In their two-hour plus talk, McQuarrie talks about taking on the project, emerging from director jail, working with Tom Cruise, the changes he made to the Lee Child book One Shot, how he tackled the issue of Reacher's size, the film's epic music-free car chase, its 70s influences, and much, much more. If you've listened to any of McQuarrie's previous spoiler special chats for Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, or Mission: Impossible — Fallout, you'll know this is pretty much essential.

Then, after that, Chris Hewitt is joined by Nick de Semlyen and James Dyer (all three diehard Reacher fans) for a talk about the movie, and the appeal of Lee Child's iconic creation. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/reacher_final_mixdown_01_d5637be9_normal.mp3
The King Of Staten Island ft. Judd Apatow,"Judd Apatow's The King Of Staten Island, starring Pete Davidson as a slacker on the eponymous New York-adjacent borough, is a cracking blend of acutely-drawn character drama and the laughs upon which Apatow has built his career. And in this very special in-depth interview with Chris Hewitt, Apatow talks about the various changes that the movie underwent during post-production, working with Davidson as both star and co-writer, and the joys of hearing Marisa Tomei say the F-word. It's a funny, frank chat, and we hope you enjoy it.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/king_of_staten_island_spoiler_sp_63078514_normal.mp3
Bad Boys For Life ft. Adil & Bilall,"We'll be honest — we weren't expecting a lot from Bad Boys For Life, the movie that reunited Will Smith's Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence's Marcus Burnett almost two decades after Bad Boys II. But, perhaps reinvigorated by new directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (credited as Adil & Bilall), it was something of an unexpected triumph. Smart, funny, with good action sequences and it even had something to say about toxic masculinity, ageing, and the nature of blockbuster heroics. 

So, with the movie making its debut on the cinema of the sofa everywhere, we have anointed it with its very own spoiler special. Chris Hewitt jumped on SquadCast with Adil & Bilall for a fun, no-holds-barred interview in which they reveal just how much of the movie was shaped on the fly, talk about its major twists and revelations, and dish on Michael Bay's oh-so-knowing cameo.

The Mandalorian Chapter 8 — Redemption,"We had to wait quite a while for the first season of The Mandalorian but now, in what feels like the blink of an eye, it is over. The season culminated in Redemption, a Taika Waititi-directed episode which blended comedy biker scouts, major revelations about Mando, Baby Yoda grinning dementedly, and a couple of major set pieces, and in our final Mando spoiler special for a while, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis get together to chew the fat, answer some listener questions, and look ahead to season 2. 

We have spoken. This is the way. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mando_chapter_8_mixdown_57f835fe_normal.mp3
Extraction Spoiler Special ft. Sam Hargrave,"If you haven't seen Extraction, the Russo Brothers-produced action flick currently blowing things up on Netflix, then you should know that Chris Hemsworth plays a man called Tyler Rake, and he kills some dudes with a rake. Of course, that's not the only thing that happens in the Joe Russo-scripted film, but it's one of the orders of business that Chris Hewitt and Helen O'Hara discuss with the film's director, Sam Hargrave, in a fun and frankly spoilerific chat about the movie, including the fate of many major characters and the film's final shot. 

On the other side of the chat with Sam Hargrave, Chris and Helen are joined by Ben Travis for an in-depth dive into the movie. They answer some listener questions and, in a segment recorded just the other day, discuss the just-announced sequel news. So sit back, relax, and enjoy Team Empire as they indulge in a spot of Netflix'n'kill.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/extraction_spoiler_special_mixdo_e0024aa5_normal.mp3
Picard Season 1 Spoiler Special ft. Sir Patrick Stewart,"You asked for us to make it so, and so we made it so. To mark the end of the first season of Star Trek: Picard, the show which sees the long-awaited return of Patrick Stewart's beloved Jean-Luc Picard, Chris Hewitt, James Dyer, and Helen O'Hara beam themselves up for an in-depth conversation about the season's twists, turns, highs, and lows. Well, James and Helen do. Chris, a casual Trekkeroonie, tries desperately to follow along on a colourful chart they made to keep him occupied. 

But that's not all. This episode also features a lengthy (and remotely recorded) chat with Picard himself, as James genuflects at the feet of Patrick Stewart, and extracts information from him with all the skill of a member of the Zhat Vash.

The Mandalorian Chapter 7: The Reckoning,"This episode of The Mandalorian (the penultimate chapter of season one, sadly) has it all: double-crosses, triple-crosses, old favourites, new faces, flying dragon things, and more Baby Yoda cuteness than you could shake a laser sword at. And, as usual, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer have convened (remotely and responsibly, of course) to talk about it at great length. All we hear is death and chaos. And terrible Werner Herzog impressions.

The Mandalorian Chapter 6: The Prisoner,"It's time to cue up Ludwig Goransson's increasingly catchy theme tune, folks, as Empire's motley band of rebels turn their attentions to the latest (in the UK, anyway) episode of The Mandalorian. And this chapter, The Prisoner, is a belter, so there's plenty for Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis to get their teeth into. So listen on for much discussion of Mando's moral code, this episode's cracking supporting cast (Clancy Brown! Bill Burr! That bloke who voices Anakin in The Clone Wars!), fleshlights, and more.

And yes, you did read 'flashlights'. You have been warned. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mando_spoiler_special_chapter_6__3ece4bbe_normal.mp3
The Raid ft. Gareth Evans,"It's here! The first of our retro spoiler specials is about a bunch of people trapped in a building that's on lockdown. But don't let that put you off — it's Gareth Evans' extraordinary, incendiary 2011 action movie, The Raid. And in this very special episode, Chris Hewitt has a lovely chat (remotely, of course) with Evans, in which they delve deep into the whys and wherefores of the Jakarta-set thriller, which made the world aware of the action movie merits of Evans and his star, Iko Uwais. And Gareth also officially spills on details of The Raid 3, and what it might have been, for the first time. 

Then, Chris is joined by fellow Raid fans, Helen O'Hara and Dan Jolin, for a chat about the movie. It's a pod so packed with goodness it'll feel like a machete to the face. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/the_raid_spoiler_special_mixdown_22dea512_normal.mp3

Then, in our virtual podbooth, Chris and Boyd are joined by Terri White and James Dyer for an in-depth discussion of the show, and its many, many rug-pulling revelations.

The Mandalorian Chapter 5: The Gunslinger,"Our latest weekly delve into The Mandalorian brings the team — Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer — to the sandy dunes of Mos Eisley on Tatooine, all the better to discuss Chapter 5 of the new Star Wars show. Along the way they discuss the episode's various in-jokes and deep cut references, Helen gets a phone call from Steven Spielberg (probably), and Ben, the kindest, gentlest soul on the team, launches all-out war on one of Hollywood's most powerful families.

The Mandalorian Chapter 4: Sanctuary,"Our weekly dissection of The Mandalorian (which is a different kind of dissection than the one Werner Herzog has in mind for Baby Yoda, should he ever get his mitts on the cute little guy) continues, as Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer and Ben Travis discuss the fourth episode of Jon Favreau's Star Wars show. 

This week's episode marks the directorial debut of one Bryce Dallas Howard, and features the introduction of a major new character in Gina Carano's Cara Dune, plus more Baby Yoda memes than you could shake a bowl of spotchka at. And our intrepid team talk about it all, answer some listener questions, and say the word 'helmet' a lot. Like, a lot. Even more so than usual. Which is saying something.

This week, Chris Hewitt, Ben Travis, Helen O'Hara, and James Dyer assemble at a responsible distance, and talk about Chapter 3 of the new Star Wars show. Featuring mangled Emperor quotes, plot discussion aplenty, and more mention of helmets than you could imagine (and we can imagine quite a bit).

The Mandalorian Chapters 1 and 2,"At long last, The Mandalorian is here. Jon Favreau's eight-part series — the first live-action Star Wars TV show, if you don't count The Holiday Special and please, for the love of God, nobody should count The Holiday Special — has finally made its UK debut on Disney+ with the first two episodes, The Mandalorian and The Child. 

And so Team Empire has reacted accordingly, with the launch of a new weekly deep dive into the show. In our first episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis gather remotely around their individual microphones and talk about a great many spoilerific things, including the true nature of Baby Yoda, and how Pedro Pascal's other characters might have fared had they been clad head-to-toe in armour. 

Enjoy. We have spoken.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mandalorian_spoiler_special_mixd_d7261d74_normal.mp3
The Invisible Man ft. Leigh Whannell,"You can't see the invisible man. But you can hear the spoiler special dedicated to the film of the same name. Which is nice. 

In our latest spoiler special, Chris Hewitt has a lovely chat with Leigh Whannell, the writer/director of the Blumhouse-produced reimagining of the classic movie monster. They talk about a great many things, including one of the great jump scares of recent years, some deleted scenes, the invisible man's motivations, and briefly swap terrible Werner Herzog impressions. 

Then, in the podbooth, Chris is joined -- as far as he can tell -- by just three colleagues of such lethal cunning: Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and Alex Godfrey, as they delve deep into the film's twists and turns, and answer some listener questions. Two things to note: while their chat is as irreverent and (hopefully) entertaining as ever, they do touch on some heavy-duty themes and subject matter, so please be aware of that. Also, there are some spoilers for Whannell's previous movie as director, Upgrade, scattered throughout, so if you haven't seen that, now might be your chance.

Onward ft.

As ever, just before you hear those four giggling idiots talk about giant sweets, major third act revelations, and say the F-word more than you might expect on a Pixar-related pod, we hear from the people who made the film: director Dan Scanlon and producer Kori Rae, who talked to Ben about the very personal story behind the film, how it changed along the way to the big screen, and more Easter eggs than you could shake a chocolate stick at.

Colour Out Of Space ft. Richard Stanley,"Ever since his nightmare experience on The Island Of Dr. Moreau, Richard Stanley — the director of cult classics Hardware and Dust Devil — has been conspicuous by his absence from the director's chair. But he puts that right, in gory, gonzo fashion with Colour Out Of Space, an adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft story, featuring an all-timer of a Nicolas Cage performance from... Nicolas Cage. And a pack of alpacas. 

In this spoiler special episode, Alex Godfrey asks Stanley about the ins, the outs, and the inside outs of making his no-holds-barred horror film. And then, in the podbooth, Chris Hewitt is joined by Alex, Helen O'Hara, and Ben Travis to discuss the movie, how Stanley's movie is a challenge to the darkness at the core of Lovecraft's own personality, and the pinkest pink.

Birds Of Prey And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn ft.

And on this special, spoiler-filled episode, Chris Hewitt has a fun chat with the movie's director, Cathy Yan, about all kinds of major reveals, minor in-jokes, and things that didn't quite make the finished film. 

Then, back in the podbooth, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara and Amon Warmann to talk about the film in great, spoilerific detail, answer your questions, and make plans for lunch. No bacon and egg sandwich for them, more's the pity.

And in this spoiler special episode of the Empire Podcast, Amon Warmann asks the film's director, Melina Matsoukas, and writer, Lena Waithe, about the key creative twists and turns in the movie. 

Then, back in the podbooth, Amon joins Helen O'Hara and Chris Hewitt for a discussion about the film that tackles the film's serious themes and message, but also has the odd light-hearted debate over knitwear and bad dates.

Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns,"1917 is the towering achievement of Sam Mendes' career as a film director: a blistering, searing, gripping real-time thriller following two soldiers in World War I as they attempt to deliver a vital message that will save thousands of lives. And in this Empire Podcast spoiler special, Ian Freer talks to Mendes and his co-writer, Krysty Wilson-Cairns, about the movie in spoilerific detail from the off.

Then, in the podbooth, Ian is joined by Chris Hewitt, Ben Travis, and Helen O'Hara to discuss their feelings about the movie, and answer a ton of listener questions. Do we do it all in a single take? We couldn't possibly say. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/1917_spoiler_special_ft_sam_mend_66e706f9_normal.mp3
Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker Spoiler Special,"Riiiiiiiiiiise. But enough about Liverpool's former Norwegian left-back. Instead, after the amuse bouche that was our mini spoiler special for the ninth and final Skywalker Saga film, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker (both of which launched just before Christmas), here's the proper thing. Almost two hours of Team Empire sat around a table, banging on about JJ Abrams' latest slice of space opera, answering listener questions, and making terrible jokes. 

So, join Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis and, now that he's come to terms with his feelings about the film, James Dyer for discussion of Emperor Palpatine's sex drive, comparison of the film's ending to, well, the ending of another recent blockbuster, and a discussion of the timeline of Rey's parents that will make your brain hurt.

Knives Out Spoiler Special ft. Rian Johnson,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out presents a very modern, and very Rian Johnsonian, twist on the murder mystery, and, in the shape of Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc, introduces a great detective to rival Columbo, Taggart, Morse and maybe even Hetty Wainthrop. And, in this long overdue Empire Podcast spoiler special, Johnson explains to Chris Hewitt how he came up with many of the film's major twists and turns. 

Then, in the podbooth, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara and Amon Warmann for a fun conversation about the movie which features much talk of sweaters, more bad Benoit Blanc impressions than you could shake a doughnut at, and much, much more. 

Again, sorry for the delay with this. We suspect foul play. Or maybe it was just the flu which sidelined Chris for a couple of weeks. Either way, it's here now, so do, please, enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/knives_out_spoiler_special_ft_ri_69140c32_normal.mp3
Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker Mini-Spoiler Special,"The saga is complete. With the release of Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, the Skywalker saga that started back in 1977 with what we now know as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is over. But the discourse has only just begun. Here is the first Empire Podcast contribution to that never-ending debate — not so much a spoiler special, more of an extended reaction pod as Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara and Ben Travis sit down and talk about key revelations and moments from JJ Abrams' film, and, like, how it made them feel, man. 

If you're wondering why this isn't a full-blown two-hour-plus spoiler special, at the time of recording Team Empire had only seen The Rise Of Skywalker once. An extended special will be recorded and released in early January after we return from our Christmas break. But we hope that this tides you over, bad impressions, terrible Star Wars planet name knowledge and all.

Joker Spoiler Special ft. Todd Phillips,"Let's put a smile on that face!

As Todd Phillips' Joker continues its bid for world domination (closing in on a billion dollars at the global box office), the Empire Podcast team give his movie the spoiler special treatment with a bumper-sized edition. First, John Nugent talks to Phillips about all manner of spoilerific stuff, and then Chris Hewitt, Terri White, Ben Travis and Alex Godfrey convene in the podbooth to talk about their reactions to the film, Joaquin Phoenix's performance, interpretations of the character Arthur Fleck and the film's violence, and more. Oh, and they ask the biggest question of them all: just who is Frowney Downwards?

It Chapter 2 Spoiler Special ft. Andy & Barbara Muschietti,"A spoiler special for a Warner Bros. film about a murderous clown can mean only one thing: yes, it's time for the podteam to grab 99 red balloons and dig their scarily sharp teeth into It Chapter 2, the sequel to 2017's phenomenally successful adaptation of (part of) Stephen King's epic horror novel. 

First, you will find Chris Hewitt talking to the film's director and producer, Andy and Barbara Muschietti, about making changes to the book, major cameos, balancing horror and comedy, and more. 

Then, in the podbooth, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara and Ben Travis to delve deep into the film, answer a bunch of listener questions and, you might not be surprised to know, unleash a torrent of innuendo.

Live Avengers: Endgame Spoiler Special ft. Kevin Feige,"As President of Marvel Studios and producer of every single Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date (all 23 of 'em, if you're reading this before May 2020), Kevin Feige has been a fundamental part of the MCU's rise and rise. Culminating with their crowning glory, the biggest film of all time, Avengers: Endgame.

When Feige popped into London recently, ahead of the film's release on home entertainment, we seized the chance to host a live Q&A with him. Just Feige, host Chris Hewitt, and a 100-strong audience, composed of Marvel fans and Empire subscribers. We see this as an absolute win. 

And in this frank and funny 50-minute chat, Chris and Feige discuss a great many things about Avengers: Endgame, all of which are spoilerific. Enter only if you've seen the movie - out now on digital platforms and from September 2nd on DVD, Blu-ray, and 3D Blu-ray.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/kevin_feige_live_avengers__endga_970c3998_normal.mp3
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Spoiler Special ft. Quentin Tarantino,"Once upon a time in the Empire podbooth, anyone? Our latest spoiler special podcast is truly special indeed, as the great Quentin Tarantino pops by to talk about his ninth (or tenth, but who's counting?) movie, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and many of its twists, turns, and third act shenanigans. 

Fresh from conducting that interview, Chris Hewitt then repairs to the podbooth to talk about the movie - its twists, turns, and third act shenanigans, and all - with Helen O'Hara, Ian Freer, and Nick de Semlyen. So sit back, relax with a drink or an acid-dipped cigarette*, and enjoy. Bear in mind: we also talk spoilers for Yesterday, Avengers: Endgame (of course), and previous Tarantino movies, so tread carefully.

Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw Spoiler Special ft. David Leitch,"Crash! Bang! Wallop! What a spoiler special! 

As the Fast & Furious franchise enters uncharted waters with its testosterone-tipped spin-off starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, so too does the Empire Podcast. This may be the ninth film in a series that has become one of the biggest of all time, but it also marks our first spoiler special dedicated to the series. 

Living their lives a quarter of a pod at a time are Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and Nick de Semlyen, who discuss the film's retconning of Statham's Deckard Shaw, the possible identity of the film's Director character, and much, much more. 

And speaking of director characters, Chris has an in-depth chat with the man who called the shots on the film, David Leitch. Almost two hours of no-holds-barred Hobbsing & Shawage? Sounds like a champagne problem to us.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/fast_furious__hobbs_shaw_spoiler_0ec4663f_normal.mp3
"Spider-Man: Far From Home Spoiler Special ft. Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, and Amy Pascal","Spoiler-Man, Spoiler-Man, spoils whatever a podcast can... Yes, in the latest Empire Podcast spoiler special, Spider-Man: Far From Home director Jon Watts, and producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal are bitten by radioactive spoilers, and develop the strange ability to tell Chris Hewitt all kinds of spoilerific stuff about the latest outing in the MCU for Tom Holland's friendly not-so-neighbourhood webslinger. From BIG reveals to Easter eggs Chris still hasn't spotted despite specifically looking out for them, there's over an hour of cracking Spidey interviews here.

Then, back in the podbooth, Chris is joined by Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, Dan Jolin, and Amon Warmann for two - count 'em, TWO! - hours of Spider-spoiler chat, including a bunch of listener questions, and a cameo even more unexpected cameo than those in the film.

Yesterday Spoiler Special ft. Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis,"Listen... do you want to know a secret? How about a ton of secrets? Specifically about the movie Yesterday? 

In our latest spoiler special podcast, Chris Hewitt chats with Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle, the writer and director, respectively, of said Beatles-centric rom-com about... well, that would be telling. But suffice it to say that something happens in Yesterday that is of such significance to Beatles fans that Chris, our very own Stanley Goodspeed, vowed to do a spoiler special on it. 

So here we are, doing that very thing. In it, you will find brief but fun and informative chats with Curtis and Boyle about alternate visions of the film, gags that didn't quite make it, their feelings on the Beatles' legacy, and much discussion of THAT moment. If you've seen the film, you'll know the one. If you haven't, just imagine it.

And in this spoiler special podcast, Fletcher sits down with Chris Hewitt to discuss his approach to seeding specific songs throughout the movie, the significant relationships in Elton's life, and some snippets that hit the cutting room floor. Be warned: strong language is in play as they discuss a pivotal line right at the end of the interview.

Avengers: Endgame Spoiler Special Interviews ft. The Russos and Markus/McFeely,"It's here. At long (long) last, the final part of our extended spoiler special celebration of all things Avengers: Endgame. This time, we let the filmmakers speak for themselves, as Chris Hewitt visits Agbo Studios, the LA HQ of the Russo brothers, for two extended spoilerific interviews with the creative teams behind the second biggest film of all time (correct at time of writing). 

First, Chris chats to Endgame writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and then follows that up by talking to the Russos themselves, Joe and Anthony. Along the way they cover the fates of pretty much every major character, the film's time-travel shenanigans, the rigidity of Thanos' bottom, and much, much more.

John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum Spoiler Special ft. Chad Stahelski,"People keep asking if we're back. And we haven't really had an answer. But now, yeah, we're thinking we're back. Or, more accurately, John Wick is, for another dose of bloody mayhem in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.

Avengers: Endgame Live Spoiler Special,"A couple of weeks ago, we took a step into the unknown, heading off to Kings Place, London (our spiritual home) to record a live spoiler special for Avengers: Endgame. Just us - Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis - and 400 of our closest friends. 

And now, because you demanded it, here is our grand experiment, for those of you who couldn't be there, and perhaps for those of you who were, so you can relive the madness. So, just in case you haven't already got your Endgame fix, here is another two hours of us banging on about the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There's a little bit of crossover with the in-studio four-hour spoiler special, but not much. And this one has extra rudeness, audience questions, and a helpful recap of the movie, in case you'd forgotten what happened in it. Oh, and we have a tombola. A FRICKIN' TOMBOLA.

And, let's be honest, some of the minor developments. And, ok, a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with Marvel at all. 

We know this is long - we know because we were there, and went slowly mad over the course of four hours - but we hope you will take this journey with us (perhaps in several chunks) as we talk Tony, Steve, Natasha, Bruce, Thor, Clint, and that purple fella in the first of our spoiler specials.

And in our latest spoiler special podcast, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, and Ben Travis get together to chat about the film in all its nonsensical, wildly entertaining glory. It's worth it just to hear Helen's pronunciation of 'Atlantean' alone. Oh, and there's a cameo from a squeaky chair. 

If that wasn't enough to entice you, the podcast kicks off with director James Wan, who talks to Chris about all kinds of spoilerific details, including the rudest sight gag we've seen in ages.

In this very special spoiler podcast dedicated to the second film in the Creed franchise, and the eighth in the Rocky series, Chris sits down with the film's director, Steven Caple Jr., for an interesting chat about many of the film's most emotional moments, from the final fight to deleted scenes and the film's unexpected reconciliations and cameos.

We couldn't agree more. Which is how Chris Hewitt found himself in a meeting room on the Paramount lot in Los Angeles, ready for another three hours with McQuarrie. And here is that chat, bringing the Fallout McQuarrie chat to a whopping six hours. 

Here, the duo discuss plenty of stuff they didn't get round to last time, including a major deleted scene between Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust; the technical challenges of the major action sequences; and McQuarrie answers plenty of questions from the listeners. And McQuarrie is on top form throughout - deeply candid, funny, and thoughtful as he shines a light on the process behind making a major blockbuster.

And now it's our turn, as Team Empire - Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Nick de Semlyen, and James Dyer - get together for a frankly chaotic and rambling discussion of the film which may not be quite as insightful, intelligent, or informative as McQuarrie, but does at least feature more Anthony Hopkins impressions than you can shake a fava bean and a bottle of chianti at, and much discussion of Ethan Hunt's sexual prowess.

First up, director J.A. Bayona tells Ben Travis how he pulled off some of the movie's spookiest sequences. FYI: this interview, sadly, was recorded on a temperamental device, and suffers from inconsistent sound levels and hissing worthy of a dilophosaurus. Then, writer/producer/director of Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow, talks to Nick de Semlyen about crafting the sequel to the (then) fourth biggest film of all time.

Along the way they answer some listener questions, debut the world's worst Jar Jar Binks impression, and dissect the Kessel Run in glorious detail. 

But that's not all. The film's director, the legend that is Ron Howard, drops by to talk to James and Nick de Semlyen about many of the film's plot twists and turns, and the odd Easter egg. Including that one. You know the one. 

So, sit back, relax and listen to our latest Solo venture.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/solo_a_star_wars_story_spoiler_s_180467dc-d78b-4aee-bd95-097f70817324_normal.mp3
Deadpool 2 Spoiler Special ft. Ryan Reynolds,"He's back! Love him, hate him, everybody can agree that he's the sharp-witted, fast-talking, wise-cracking SOB that the world needs right now. But enough about Empire's Nick de Semlyen - Deadpool is also back, in the stunningly unimaginatively titled Deadpool 2, and in our latest spoiler special, Chris Hewitt assembles his very own X-Force to talk about the film in spoilerific detail. There's Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and - yes! - Nick, talking through the film's key talking points, and answering some of your questions into the bargain.

But that's not all. This episode also features an in-depth chat between Chris and the man who, quite simply, is Wade Wilson - Deadpool 2 writer/producer/star/bloke who runs the craft services, Ryan Rodney Reynolds. And they talk about everything, from secret cameos (not Dickie Greenleaf, though; Chris only noticed that on the second viewing, dammit) to major deaths. And they have a lot of fun and learn a little bit about themselves along the way.

Avengers: Infinity War Spoiler Special,"It's all been leading to this. Ten years, nineteen films... one enormo-pod. 

Yes, it's our Avengers: Infinity War spoiler special podcast, in which our very own team of Podvengers - Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Dan Jolin, and James Dyer -come together to chat about Marvel Studios' most epic blockbuster to date. They talk about that thing that happened in the Russo Brothers' film, that other thing, some other stuff, and tackle some of your questions as well. And they drone on so long you might want to use the Time Stone. 

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy almost three hours of rampant speculation, semi-educated guesses, and the usual rambling nonsense, including a truly dreadful Peter Dinklage impression. Oh, and a swearier Helen than usual. Language!",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/avengers_infinity_war_spoiler_sp_a1e023fb-63c1-42c1-bb86-b4d54f23ce14_normal.mp3
Ready Player One Spoiler Special ft. Ernest Cline,"Ready, players? Here it is - Empire's spoiler special dedicated to the latest movie from Sir Steven of Spielberg, Ready Player One, the biggest slice of virtual insanity since Jamiroquai donned that big hat and slid all over the shop. 

It starts with an exclusive, spoiler-filled chat with Ernest Cline, the film's co-screenwriter and author of the book upon which the film is based. He talks to Ben Travis about bringing the film to the big screen, how they formatted the three tasks structure, and the film's shining hour: a trip inside a classic movie. 

Then it's to the podbooth, where Chris Hewitt recruits James Dyer and Empire's resident Spielberg expert, Ian Freer, to talk about the film in great detail and answer some reader questions. On your marks. Get set... Go!",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/ready_player_one_spoiler_special_bf5f6923-8356-4a41-91f4-c16cea15857d_normal.mp3
A Quiet Place Spoiler Special ft. John Krasinski,"How much do we love John Krasinski's astounding high-concept horror movie, A Quiet Place? So much we decided to dedicate a very last-minute spoiler special to it. That's how much. 

Last minute it may have been, but we managed to recruit Krasinski - the film's star/writer/director and, as he points out to Chris Hewitt, executive producer and bloke who makes the tea - to talk us through the film's major revelations and answer the question on everyone's lips: in a world where sound will kill you, how can you possibly...? Well, you'll have to listen to it to find out. 

Back in the podbooth, Chris is joined by Empire's Editor-in-Chief, Terri White, and James Dyer and Ben Travis to shout from the rooftops about one of the best movies of 2018 so far. ENJOY.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/a_quiet_place_spoiler_special_ft_90c51dd2-bb08-4f7d-aa82-46f5c9cfbfe5_normal.mp3
The Cloverfield Paradox ft. J.J. Abrams and Julius Onah,"Unless you've been stranded on a space station, battling with a temperamental particle accelerator, you probably know that The Cloverfield Paradox - the latest entry in the burgeoning Cloverfield franchise - changed the game a couple of weeks ago, when it dropped, with very little warning, on Netflix for the world to see whilst lounging around in their shorts.

And now that you've had time to do just that, now is the time to bring your ears to our latest spoiler special, in which Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, and pod newbie Ben Travis drill deep into the Julius Onah-directed sci-fi chiller.

But that's not all. The podcast kicks off with an exclusive chat between Our Ben and Julius Onah and his producer/Cloverfield overlord, one J.J. Abrams. And it's filled with spoilertastic goodies.

So kick back, relax, ignore the sound of that disembodied arm scratching at the window, and enjoy...",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/the_cloverfield_paradox_spoiler__9f362a52-e2ba-4de8-97ff-b4bb050e317a_normal.mp3
"Black Panther Spoiler Special ft. Ryan Coogler, Nate Moore","Wakanda Forever! In this very special edition of the Empire Podcast, we dig deep into the 18th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Ryan Coogler's Black Panther, the story of newly-crowned King Of Wakanda, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).

As usual, the podteam - Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Terri White, and James Dyer - are on hands to answer listener questions and talk about the film in extraordinary detail, Ulysses Klaue mixtapes and all.

But they're not alone. The podcast kicks off with Chris talking to two of the driving forces behind a movie that, even before its record-breaking opening weekend, felt like one of the most significant movies, not just in Marvel Studios' ten year history, but in the history of modern blockbusters.

First off, he talks to co-writer/director Ryan Coogler about all sorts of stuff, including the fate of major characters, the film's thematic preoccupations, and how he decided to end the movie.

Then, the movie's executive producer Nate Moore, who",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/black_panther_spoiler_special_ry_8204c0f1-1ac9-45b0-906e-c06b7d58a64e_normal.mp3
Blade Runner Spoiler Special ft. Denis Villeneuve,"There was a danger, at one point, that our Blade Runner 2049 spoiler special podcast wouldn't arrive until 2049 itself. But here it is, lovingly timed to coincide with the UK home entertainment release of Denis Villeneuve's beautiful, profound, thought-provoking sequel.

And, assembling in the Empire podbooth to answer your questions and chew the fat on the film's many open-ended questions are Dan Jolin, John Nugent and, with Chris Hewitt on the run having failed the Voight-Kampff test, your host Helen O'Hara. Be warned: those of you with sensitive ears should know that Dan was particularly sweary on this episode. Earmuffs, people.

But that's not all - the film's director, the great Denis Villeneuve, pops by to talk to Nick de Semlyen about some of the movie's mysteries from Deckard to Deckard's dog. Oh, and the bees. Not the bees!

We hope you enjoy, and that you'll think it's been worth the wait. If not, remember one thing: all these podcasts will be lost in time. Like tears i",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/blade_runner_spoiler_special_ft__626c2732-65f4-4e36-b5ca-92feb6554447_normal.mp3

In this two-hour behemoth, the Empire Podcast team — Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ian Freer — have a good old spoiler-heavy chat about the ups and downs, and the ins and outs of Episode VIII, and tackle a whole bunch of listeners' questions. Let's just say this is not going to go the way you think.

First up, though, is Chris' chat with the film's writer/director, Rian Johnson, who was in great form as he expounded on some of the film's most shocking revelations, as well as shedding more light on his love of Adrian Edmondson. Which is, perhaps, the most shocking revelation of them all.
