21,The Mandalorian Chapter 16 — The Rescue,"This is it, folks: the last episode (for now) of The Mandalorian, and as a result, the last spoiler special discussing The Mandalorian. In this extended episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis discuss the many major revelations, twists, and cameos of Chapter 16, take a bunch of listener questions, and ask where the show can go now that [REDACTED].

22,The Mandalorian Chapter 15 -- The Believer,"The penultimate chapter of the second season of The Mandalorian is a thrill-packed death-defying ride that tips its helmet to one of the greatest movies of all time, The Wages Of Fear. In this episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer and Ben Travis discuss that, the way in which the episode challenges Mando's core beliefs and pushes him to do something truly startling, the absence of a key character, and much, much more. Is there also singing and a plethora of helmet gags? Well, this is the way.

23,The Mandalorian Chapter 14 -- The Tragedy,"With a title like that, Team Empire wades gingerly into this week's episode of The Mandalorian, discussing the return of [REDACTED], the fate of [EVEN MORE REDACTED], and Pedro Pascal's [TRIPLE REDACTED].

24,The Mandalorian Chapter 13 — The Jedi,"This week's episode of The Mandalorian was perhaps the most eventful yet, with huge revelations about our beloved Baby Yoda, the first live-action appearance of animated series stalwart Ahsoka Tano (played here by Rosario Dawson), and a grizzled cameo by Kyle Reese and Dwayne Hicks himself, Michael Biehn. Plenty for our podteam — Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer — to get their teeth into, then. So, naturally, in an episode that's even more chaotic than usual, why on Corvus are they talking about Sunset Beach, Neighbours, and Han and Leia's sexual proclivities?

26,The Mandalorian Chapter 12 -- The Siege ft. Carl Weathers,"This week's deep dive into the spoilery seas of The Mandalorian sees a very special guest tag along for the ride — the legendary Carl Weathers, who not only returns to the show for this episode as Greef Karga, but also slides into the director's chair, and oversees more action than you could shake a speeder bike at. In our extended chat, he talks to Chris Hewitt about his approach as a director, working with Baby Yoda, handling the action scenes, and more. 

Then, on the other side of Carl, Team Empire — Chris, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis — convene for another in-depth discussion of the show, featuring so much talk of baked goods that you might be forgiven for thinking you've come to the wrong show, and another landmark moment in the slow but steady, Anakin-esque corruption of the previously pure Ben Travis.

27,The Mandalorian Chapter 11 -- The Heiress,"This week's squidtastic breakdown of the latest episode of The Mandalorian finds Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis wrapping their tentacles around the wettest live-action iteration of Star Wars to date. Join them as they discuss all the ins and outs of this Bryce Dallas Howard-directed episode, featuring huge revelations for Mando, a moment of peril for Baby Yoda, and a merman in a sweater. 

Oh, and don't query them on their knowledge of Star Wars: Rebels and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. If there's one thing that this episode makes clear, it's that the gang watch those shows religiously and know them inside out. Ahem. 

Enjoy. This is the way.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mandalorian_chapter_11_spoiler_s_3738ce81_normal.mp3
28,The Mandalorian Chapter 10: The Passenger,"Mando and Baby Yoda (note: may not be their official character names) are back for another instalment of the live-action Star Wars TV show, and so are Team Empire. In this week's episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Baby Yoda apologist Ben Travis assemble to discuss the Timothy Olyphant-free zone that is The Passenger. It's got it all: terrible impressions, big theories about the show's direction, and one of the team shares a terrifying tale of a very close encounter with a spider. Arachnophobes, you have been warned. 

Enjoy. We have spoken.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mandalorian_chapter_10_spoiler_s_d3a8a1ca_normal.mp3
29,The Mandalorian Chapter 9: The Marshal,"The Mandalorian is back, Baby Yoda in tow, for a second season of the Disney+ show that is breathing new life into Star Wars. And so, naturally, we've reassembled the old podcast crew -- Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis, who's this close to triggering a court order from Baby Yoda -- to have a natter about the first episode of the second season. 

It's called The Marshal, it's the longest episode to date, and it's filled with all kinds of Star Warsy goodness. And in this, the first of our weekly spoiler specials, the team discuss the episode, its numerous in-jokes, Easter eggs and references, how it might fit into the overarching story of the show and, of course, the Star Wars debut of Timothy Olyphant, making a strong play for the coveted Handsomest Man In The Galaxy award. If you want plenty of Star Wars discussion and much thirsting over Cobb Vanth, you've come to the right place.

47,The Mandalorian Chapter 8 — Redemption,"We had to wait quite a while for the first season of The Mandalorian but now, in what feels like the blink of an eye, it is over. The season culminated in Redemption, a Taika Waititi-directed episode which blended comedy biker scouts, major revelations about Mando, Baby Yoda grinning dementedly, and a couple of major set pieces, and in our final Mando spoiler special for a while, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis get together to chew the fat, answer some listener questions, and look ahead to season 2. 

We have spoken. This is the way. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mando_chapter_8_mixdown_57f835fe_normal.mp3
50,The Mandalorian Chapter 7: The Reckoning,"This episode of The Mandalorian (the penultimate chapter of season one, sadly) has it all: double-crosses, triple-crosses, old favourites, new faces, flying dragon things, and more Baby Yoda cuteness than you could shake a laser sword at. And, as usual, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer have convened (remotely and responsibly, of course) to talk about it at great length. All we hear is death and chaos. And terrible Werner Herzog impressions. 

Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mandalorian_chapter_7_spoiler_sp_867d2a97_normal.mp3
51,The Mandalorian Chapter 6: The Prisoner,"It's time to cue up Ludwig Goransson's increasingly catchy theme tune, folks, as Empire's motley band of rebels turn their attentions to the latest (in the UK, anyway) episode of The Mandalorian. And this chapter, The Prisoner, is a belter, so there's plenty for Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis to get their teeth into. So listen on for much discussion of Mando's moral code, this episode's cracking supporting cast (Clancy Brown! Bill Burr! That bloke who voices Anakin in The Clone Wars!), fleshlights, and more.

And yes, you did read 'flashlights'. You have been warned. Enjoy.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mando_spoiler_special_chapter_6__3ece4bbe_normal.mp3
54,The Mandalorian Chapter 5: The Gunslinger,"Our latest weekly delve into The Mandalorian brings the team — Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, Ben Travis, and James Dyer — to the sandy dunes of Mos Eisley on Tatooine, all the better to discuss Chapter 5 of the new Star Wars show. Along the way they discuss the episode's various in-jokes and deep cut references, Helen gets a phone call from Steven Spielberg (probably), and Ben, the kindest, gentlest soul on the team, launches all-out war on one of Hollywood's most powerful families.

55,The Mandalorian Chapter 4: Sanctuary,"Our weekly dissection of The Mandalorian (which is a different kind of dissection than the one Werner Herzog has in mind for Baby Yoda, should he ever get his mitts on the cute little guy) continues, as Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer and Ben Travis discuss the fourth episode of Jon Favreau's Star Wars show. 

This week's episode marks the directorial debut of one Bryce Dallas Howard, and features the introduction of a major new character in Gina Carano's Cara Dune, plus more Baby Yoda memes than you could shake a bowl of spotchka at. And our intrepid team talk about it all, answer some listener questions, and say the word 'helmet' a lot. Like, a lot. Even more so than usual. Which is saying something.

56,The Mandalorian Chapter 3: The Sin,"And so, as The Mandalorian moves to a weekly schedule on Disney+, so too do our spoiler specials. This week, Chris Hewitt, Ben Travis, Helen O'Hara, and James Dyer assemble at a responsible distance, and talk about Chapter 3 of the new Star Wars show. Featuring mangled Emperor quotes, plot discussion aplenty, and more mention of helmets than you could imagine (and we can imagine quite a bit).

57,The Mandalorian Chapters 1 and 2,"At long last, The Mandalorian is here. Jon Favreau's eight-part series — the first live-action Star Wars TV show, if you don't count The Holiday Special and please, for the love of God, nobody should count The Holiday Special — has finally made its UK debut on Disney+ with the first two episodes, The Mandalorian and The Child. 

And so Team Empire has reacted accordingly, with the launch of a new weekly deep dive into the show. In our first episode, Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, James Dyer, and Ben Travis gather remotely around their individual microphones and talk about a great many spoilerific things, including the true nature of Baby Yoda, and how Pedro Pascal's other characters might have fared had they been clad head-to-toe in armour. 

Enjoy. We have spoken.",https://bauernordic-pods.sharp-stream.com/gb/1206/mandalorian_spoiler_special_mixd_d7261d74_normal.mp3
